## Hello World
Hi all and welcome to my blog. This is my quick intoduction;

I’m Jesse, also known as [r00tkit__](https://twitter.com/r00tkit__) on Twitter, I am an aspiring red team operator but I like Malware and rootkit, especially coding them for fun and I do code security tools . **I am not a bug hunter**. I’m 15 year old and currently in high school and I will use this space for writing content about anything new I learn.
