## Hello World
Hi all and welcome to my blog. This is my quick introduction;

I’m Jesse, also known as [Sasha0x01_](https://twitter.com/Sasha0x01_) on Twitter, I am an aspiring red team operator but I like Malware and rootkit, especially coding them for fun and I do code security tools. I am not a bug hunter. I’m 15 years old and currently in high school and I will use this space for writing content about anything new I learn.
