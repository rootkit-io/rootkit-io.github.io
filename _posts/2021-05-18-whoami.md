## Hello World
Hi all and welcome to my blog. This is my quick intoduction;

I’m Jesse, also known as [r00tkit__](https://twitter.com/r00tkit__) on Twitter, I am an aspiring red team operator but I like Malware and rootkit, especially coding them for fun and I do code security tools . **I am not a bug hunter**. I’m 15 year old and currently in high school and I think I will not study cyber security in university because I think that will be boring. I will use this space for writing content about anything new I learn. And yea I will be sharing any new technique related to red teaming. I've tried writing or making tutorials regarding security but failed but this time I will not stop this time.

## Thanks
