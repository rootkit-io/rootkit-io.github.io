## Hello World
Hi all and welcome to my blog. This is my quick intoduction;

I'm Jesse, also known as [r00tkit__](https://twitter.com/r00tkit__) on Twitter, I am a aspiring red teamer but I like Malware and rootkit specially coding them for fun also code security tools . **I am not a bug hunter**.
I'm 15 year old and currently in high school and I think I will not study cyber security in university because I think that will be boring. I will use this space for writing security tools, malware and rootkits.
And yea I will be sharing any new technique related to red teaming i've tried writing or making tutorial regarding security but failed but this time I will not stop.


## Thanks 
Huge thanks to the these two mates because of them i again started a blog :D
